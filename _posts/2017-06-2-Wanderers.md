Humans often think about travel to other planets in our solar system. After leaving Earthâ€™s atmosphere, visits to these planets would face crushing gravity, long periods of darkness, unbreathable air, and dangerous temperatures. This series of 3D wearables explores the idea of life-sustaining clothing that would transform dangerous planetary elements into ones that support human life. Mushtari, Zuhal, and Otaared (which are Arabic names) are clothing designed for their respective difficult environments of Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury.
