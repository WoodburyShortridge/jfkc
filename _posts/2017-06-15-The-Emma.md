Zhang and Villar created this prototype wearable device for graphic designer Emma Lawton. Lawton has Parkinson’s disease, which affects the brain’s ability to control muscle movements. The device vibrates to disrupt the feedback loop between her hand and brain and allows Lawton to make straight lines so she can write and draw clearly again.
