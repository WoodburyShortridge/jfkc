Chris Downey is an architect, planner, and consultant who is blind and uses raised-line drawings in his work. Downey lost all of his vision suddenly in 2008 while he was a practicing architect. He now helps design teams and clients create enriching environments for both people with vision loss and people with average vision. Raised-line drawings such as these make printed architectural plans accessible to Downey.
