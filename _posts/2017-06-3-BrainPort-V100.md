BrainPort V100 translates images from a wearable video camera into electrical stimulation patterns on the tongue. Users feel moving bubble-like patterns and learn to interpret them as the shape, size, location, and motion of objects captured by their cameras. Some users have described the experience as being able to “see with your tongue.”
