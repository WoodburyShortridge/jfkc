The e-NABLE Community provides free and low-cost, body-powered 3D printable assistive devices for individuals with upper-limb differences. The designs for these devices are shared as open-source files, which means that anyone  anywhere can 3D print them and use them for personal use.

Ivan Owen, a puppeteer and artist in the United States, co-created the first 3D printed hand for Liam, a young child in South Africa. Thanks to the e-NABLE Community of more than 10,000 volunteers worldwide, approximately 3,000 3D printed hands have been gifted to individuals in over 80 countries.  The two devices in this exhibit belong to Luke Dennison and Cam Haight.
