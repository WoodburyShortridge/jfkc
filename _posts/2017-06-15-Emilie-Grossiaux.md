Emily Gossiaux was a Cooper Union art student in New York City when a truck hit her while she was riding her bicycle. She lost her vision as a result of the accident. She moved to Minnesota to take braille and computer classes and joined a study of the BrainPort Vision Device. She started using the BrainPort to draw and then created ceramic pieces from her sketches. Gossiaux is a practicing artist and is enrolled in a master of fine arts program at Yale University. Gossiaux is a 2013 VSA Emerging Young Artist.
