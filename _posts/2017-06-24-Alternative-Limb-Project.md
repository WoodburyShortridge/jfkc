Sophie Oliveira Barata, founder of The
Alternative Limb Project, creates her
art within prosthetic arms and legs.
Ms. Oliveira Barata believes
prostheses are parts of peopleâ€™s
personalities so she uses them to
explore body image, modification,
disability, and body diversity. She
works with specialists in 3D modeling
and other technologies to create each
piece of art.


This arm was designed for model Kelly
Knox who was born without a forearm.
Ms. Knox is an internationally
recognized model, performance artist,
and advocate for diversity in fashion.
