Sophie Oliveira Barata, founder of The
Alternative Limb Project, creates her
art within prosthetic arms and legs.
Ms. Oliveira Barata believes
prostheses are parts of people’s
personalities so she uses them to
explore body image, modification,
disability, and body diversity. She
works with specialists in 3D modeling
and other technologies to create each
piece of art.

'Synchronised’ by the Alternative limb project
A collaboration between Sophie de Oliveira and Dani Clode with support from Jason Taylor:

This arm was designed for model Kelly
Knox who was born without a forearm.
Ms. Knox is an internationally
recognized model, performance artist,
and advocate for diversity in fashion.

They worked alongside disability activist model, Kelly Knox, exploring the possibilities of creating a new kind of prosthetic for her. The arm is made out of electroplated gold carbon fibre, and clear acrylic layers that form a layered, mirrored recreation of her biological arm. The internal electronics take a reading of her pulse, and then output as one of the acrylic layers  ( in the wrist) ticking along to her heart beat. It can also continue to tick when she is not wearing it. It was designed for the realm of gestural jewelry and body sculpture, and comes with two removable hands, one clear and one blue.
