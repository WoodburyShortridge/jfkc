The robotic drumming prosthesis was developed for Jason Barnes, a drummer who lost his right arm in an electrical accident. Professor Gil Weinberg designed the prosthesis with motors that power two drumsticks. One stick has sensors that respond to Barnes’ bicep muscles. The other stick has its own computer “musical brain” that allows it to improvise with the music being played. Weinberg said, “The second drumstick has a mind of its own. The drummer essentially becomes a cyborg.”
