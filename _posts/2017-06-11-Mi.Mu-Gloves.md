Mi.Mu gloves are musical instruments and wearable technology. Musician and artist Imogen Heap and a team of innovators created them to produce and manipulate sound by gesture using a computer interface. In 2015, the first users of the gloves included musician Kris Halpin of Drake Music. Drake Music is the leading British organization working in music, disability, and technology.  

â€œThis is the first thing that you could call accessible technology that has a degree of virtuosity to it ... With the gloves, you can do something quite simple and make a really impressive sound; but there's room to get deeper, and there's room to learn it as well as an instrument, and there feels like a skill level, like a real instrument has."
Kris Halpin from the video "The Gloves Are On"
