Sophie de Oliveira Barata, founder of The
Alternative Limb Project, creates her
art within prosthetic arms and legs.
De Oliveira Barata believes
prostheses are parts of peopleâ€™s
personalities so she uses them to
explore body image, modification,
disability, and body diversity. She
works with specialists in 3D modeling
and other technologies to create each
piece of art.

"Syncronised," by The Alternative Limb Project, is a collaboration between Sophie de Oliveira Barata and Dani Clode, with support from Jason Taylor.  This arm was designed for Kelly Knox, who was born without a forearm. Knox is an internationally recognized model, performance artist, and advocate for diversity in fashion.  De Oliveira Barata and Clode worked alongside Knox to design a new kind of prosthetic for her.  The arm is made out of electroplated gold carbon fiber and clear acrylic layers.  Together they form a layered, mirrored re-creation of her biological arm.  The limb's internal electronics read her pulse and then send a signal of her ticking heart beat to the wrist layer.  The prosthesis can also tick when she is not wearing it.  The limb was designed as jewelry and body sculpture.  It has two removable hands -- one clear and one blue.
