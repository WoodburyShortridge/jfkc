NAO is a human-like robot designed originally to assist children who have autism spectrum disorder (ASD). NAO helps bridge communication between children with ASD and the people around them. He is friendly looking and predictable and he reduces childrenâ€™s anxiety, offers encouragement, and builds trust.

NAO's activities can also be customized to let him join new worlds outside of education. He provides reception and concierge services for guests at hotels, where he is able to speak in a variety of languages. NAO is also part of a dance troupe with human dancers and with other NAOs.
