Carpal Skin is a prototype for a protective	glove to protect against Carpal	Tunnel Syndrome. Night-time wrist splinting	is the recommended treatment for most patients before going	into carpal	tunnel release surgery.	Carpal Skin	maps the pain-profile of a particular patients—its intensity and duration—limiting movement	in a customized	fashion. Carpal	Tunnel is one of the most common reasons for functional limitations	among musicians. Originally	exhibited at the Museum	of Science in Boston.
