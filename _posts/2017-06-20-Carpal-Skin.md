Carpal	Skin	is	a	prototype	for	a
protective	glove	to	protect	against
Carpal	Tunnel	Syndrome.	Night-time
wrist	splinting	is	the	recommended
treatment	for	most	patients	before
going	into	carpal	tunnel	release
surgery.	Carpal	Skin	maps	the	pain-profile
of	a	particular	patients—its
intensity	and	duration—limiting
movement	in	a	customized	fashion.
Carpal	Tunnel	is	one	of	the	most
common	reasons	for	functional
limitations	among	musicians.
Originally	exhibited	at	the	Museum	of
Science	in	Boston.
