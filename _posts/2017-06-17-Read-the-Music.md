Read the Music is an optical scanner for sheet music. Musicians who are blind or others who cannot read printed or handwritten sheet music can use this device to hear the notes played. A metronome function assists in learning the rhythm of the music. Musicians can then replicate the music and its rhythm on their instruments.
