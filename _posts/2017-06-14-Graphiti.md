Graphiti is a prototype tactile touch display that enables people who are blind or have low vision to access onscreen graphic and photographic information and to draw their own graphics. Moving pins of varied heights convey topography, graphic elements, and shades of grey and color to the userâ€™s fingers. A touch interface allows the user to draw a shape with a fingertip, which raises the pins along the traced path. Through design and technology, 2D graphic information becomes accessible through touch.
