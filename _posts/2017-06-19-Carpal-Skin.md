The Carpal Skin glove prototype was designed by Neri Oxman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab.  The glove was created to manage the pain of carpal tunnel syndrome. Each glove will be designed for a specific person, with hard and soft areas that address that person’s areas of pain.  The glove limits the hand’s movement in some areas – like a splint – and frees movement in others.
