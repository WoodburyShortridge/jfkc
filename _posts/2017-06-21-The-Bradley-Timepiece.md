The Bradley Timepiece is a sleek, modern watch that can be touched and seen to tell time. The watch, therefore, provides equal access for people who are blind, have low vision, or have average vision. Eone’s mission is to redefine good design as beautiful, functional, and inclusive — what the company describes as “Design for Everyone.” 

A person can tell time by touch with this watch by using its raised markers that represent the watch’s numbers and two magnetized ball bearings that represent the watch’s hour and minute hands.  One ball bearing on the face of the watch indicates minutes and one around the outside edge of the face shows hours. To read the time, a person runs a finger over the raised markers and then feels where the ball bearings are located. If the ball bearings move out of place, the person shakes the watch to make them snap back to the correct locations.
