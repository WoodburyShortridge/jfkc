Thync Relax is an electrical stimulation device that activates the body’s autonomic nervous system (the system that regulates the heart, some muscles, and other parts of the body without voluntary actions from the person) to “rest and digest” rather than “fight or take flight.” The device relieves anxiety and stress, and helps with sleep.
