The developers of the WHILL power wheelchair wanted to improve the personal mobility experience with innovative design and advanced technology. Their focus on style and independence resulted in a wheelchair that is attractive, operated intuitively, and has a very small turning radius for maneuverability indoors. The WHILL also has four-wheel drive for independent transportation outdoors on steep inclines and on most surfaces, including sand, grass, and rocks.
