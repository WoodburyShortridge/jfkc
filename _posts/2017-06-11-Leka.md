Leka is an interactive and multi-sensory smart toy. Its name is Swedish and means “to play” and “to care for.” This robot helps children with autism learn how to interact and communicate with family and friends. Leka can be customized for individuals and produces colors, sounds, music, movements, and soothing vibrations that encourage play with others as well as guides independent daily tasks and learning.
