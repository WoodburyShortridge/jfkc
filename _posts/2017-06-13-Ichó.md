Four students from Düsseldorf University of Applied Sciences designed ichó based on experiences with their grandparents who have dementia. Ichó is a ball that makes music, glows, and vibrates when it is thrown, caught, stroked, pressed, or rolled. 

Ichó helps people with dementia and memory difficulties by presenting familiar sounds and individualized music selections to recognize and enjoy. People can listen to traditional fairy tales on ichó and use the ball act to out the story or interact with others through games like “hot potato.” “Hot potato” requires passing the ichó to others before its color turns red and “hot.” Ichó provides multi-sensory information to help stimulate attention, recognition, and enjoyment.
