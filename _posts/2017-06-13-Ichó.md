Ichó is a ball which reacts to all external interactions such as pressure, catching, petting, and throwing. ichó responds with coloured light, vibration, music, and sounds while a focus on the promotion of the user’s motor and cognitive function. 
What is exceptional about ichó is the targeted individualized support to the user, facilitated through ichó's  ability to be modified quickly and on the run via a mobile phone app. Therefore every user is able to receive an entirely new, playful, and personalized experience during therapy.
 
ichó concentrates on communication for those who struggle communicating and brings people together. Communication is our primary way of engagement with society and losing it diminishes connection and quality of life. 
ichó is able to achieve an important contribution to the integration of cognitively challenged people into society and to research about interventions that may show promise for a condition that is becoming more common across the globe.
 
We are four Hochschule Düsseldorf graduates from Germany who started working on technical and creative approaches to dementia because our grandparents suffer from it.
