Four students who graduated from the University of Applied Sciences Düsseldorf designed ichó based on experiences with their grandparents who have dementia. Ichó is a ball that reacts with music, vibrations, colored light, and sounds when it is thrown, caught, stroked, petted, or rolled. Ichó’s programs can be modified with a smartphone app and customized for individuals.

Ichó encourages people to interact and communicate with others.  It can be programmed for group activities such as games and acting out fairy tales. Ichó provides multi-sensory information to help stimulate attention, communication, and memory in an effort to improve the quality of life for people with dementia.
