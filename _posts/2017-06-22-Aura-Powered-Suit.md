The Aura Powered Suit is Powered Clothing(TM) designed to provide programmable strength and power for core wellness and mobility assistance. The suit is worn as an undergarment, fitted to grip the body, and equipped with mechanics that connect each of the main muscle points. As the wearer attempts to sit or stand, the suit recognizes the movement and activates integrated electric muscles that augment the wearer's strength and power. The final product will embed the green support bands and hexagonal hardware pods so that the garment is both comfortable and stylish.
