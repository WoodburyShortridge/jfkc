Neil Harbisson became a cyborg when he implanted an eyeborg antenna inside his skull. Harbisson has a rare form of color blindness called achromotopsia and only sees shades of black, white, and gray. By using his eyeborg, color becomes sound for him through computer chip conversion of hue to frequency. His art explores the relationship between color and sound and their connection to human perception.
