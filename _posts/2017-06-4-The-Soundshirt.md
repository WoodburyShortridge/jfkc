The Soundshirt provides a tactile and visual experience of live music for audience members who are deaf. The shirt was created in collaboration with the Junge Symphoniker Orchestra in Hamburg, Germany. Microphones placed in the orchestra capture the music and send it to a computer that transforms it into data. This data is sent to the wireless actuators in the shirt that then vibrate according to the musics intensity. The sounds are felt as haptic sensations and appear as moving lights in different locations on the shirt depending on whether they are delicate sounds from a violin or heavy ones from a drum.
