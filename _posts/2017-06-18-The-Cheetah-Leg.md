The Cheetah Leg is an example of streamlined design that produces power and agility. The prosthesis imitates the running movements of a cheetah, the world’s fastest land animal: the foot of a cheetah’s hind leg extends and reaches to the ground while the animal’s thigh muscles pulls its body forward. The Cheetah Leg is so effective that there has been controversy about whether it gives racers using it an unfair advantage in competitions over racers without amputations. April Holmes and Jerome Singleton used these Cheetah legs in competitions.
