The Cheetah Leg is an example of streamlined design that produces power and agility. The prosthesis’ design was inspired by the anatomy of a cheetah, the world’s fastest land animal, and designed to mimic the anatomical foot/ankle joint action of able-bodied runners. Made of carbon fiber composite, the iconic Cheetah has been the uncontested “gold standard” for elite and recreational amputee athletes for 20 years. April Holmes and Jerome Singleton used these Cheetah legs in competitions.
